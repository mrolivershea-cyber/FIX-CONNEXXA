# Security Summary - CONNEXA v7.4.6

## Overview

This document addresses security considerations for the CONNEXA v7.4.6 critical fixes implementation.

## CodeQL Security Scan Results

**Scan Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Total Alerts:** 4  
**Critical Issues:** 0  
**Status:** ✅ All alerts reviewed and addressed

---

## Alert Analysis

### 1. Clear-text Storage in app/backend/pptp_tunnel_manager.py (Line 192)

**Alert:** `py/clear-text-storage-sensitive-data`  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTED - Required by Protocol

**Details:**
- Password stored in clear text in `/etc/ppp/chap-secrets` file
- This is **required** by the PPTP/pppd protocol
- MSCHAP-v2 authentication requires clear-text passwords in chap-secrets

**Mitigation:**
1. **File Permissions:** Set to 600 (owner read/write only)
   ```python
   os.chmod(chap_file, 0o600)
   ```

2. **File Location:** Protected system directory `/etc/ppp/`
   - Only root can access
   - Not web-accessible

3. **Protocol Requirement:** This is how pppd/PPTP works
   - No alternative for MSCHAP-v2 authentication
   - Industry standard practice

4. **Documentation:** Added security note in code:
   ```python
   # SECURITY NOTE: Clear-text password storage is required by pppd/PPTP protocol
   # The chap-secrets file must contain passwords in clear text for MSCHAP-v2 authentication
   # We mitigate this by setting file permissions to 600 (owner read/write only)
   ```

**Recommendation:** Accepted as necessary for PPTP functionality. Consider migrating to more secure VPN protocols (WireGuard, OpenVPN) in future versions.

### 2-4. Clear-text Logging in examples/test_pptp_manager.py (Lines 144, 146, 218)

**Alert:** `py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data`  
**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** ✅ FALSE POSITIVE - Test Code Only

**Details:**
- Alerts in test file, not production code
- Variables named `password_placeholder` and templates containing "{password}"
- No actual sensitive data - just test placeholders
- Test output uses `***PASSWORD***` placeholder

**Evidence:**
```python
# Line 134: Using placeholder, not real password
password_placeholder = "***PASSWORD***"

# Line 141: Test format validation
new_format = f'"{username}" "{remotename}" "{password_placeholder}" *\n'

# Lines 144, 146: Print test output
print(f"   {old_format.strip()}")  # Contains ***PASSWORD***
print(f"   {new_format.strip()}")  # Contains ***PASSWORD***

# Line 218: Template string, not actual logging
success_log_template = "✅ Tunnel for node {node_id} is UP..."
```

**Mitigation:**
- Test file clearly documents this is for format validation
- No real passwords used in tests
- Added note: "Sensitive data never logged"

**Recommendation:** False positive. Scanner detected variable names containing "password" or "secret" but these are test placeholders, not actual sensitive data.

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. File Permissions
- ✅ `/etc/ppp/chap-secrets`: Mode 600 (owner only)
- ✅ `/etc/ppp/peers/connexa-node-*`: Mode 600 (owner only)

### 2. No Sensitive Data in Logs
- ✅ Passwords never logged
- ✅ Only connection status and IPs logged
- ✅ Test code uses placeholders

### 3. Secure Storage
- ✅ Credentials stored in protected system directories
- ✅ No credentials in code repository
- ✅ No credentials in environment variables

### 4. Input Validation
- ✅ Database queries use parameterized statements
- ✅ No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- ✅ Proper error handling

### 5. Network Security
- ✅ Documentation for firewall rules
- ✅ GRE and TCP 1723 properly configured
- ✅ Recommendations for cloud security groups

---

## Known Limitations

### PPTP Protocol Security

**Issue:** PPTP is considered less secure than modern VPN protocols

**Mitigation:**
1. Use strong passwords (12+ characters)
2. Enable MSCHAP-v2 (implemented)
3. Use MPPE encryption (configured)
4. Restrict access via firewall rules
5. Monitor failed authentication attempts

**Recommendation:** Consider migrating to:
- WireGuard (best performance and security)
- OpenVPN (widely supported, very secure)
- IPSec/IKEv2 (enterprise grade)

## Vulnerability Assessment

| Category | Risk Level | Status | Notes |
|----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| SQL Injection | None | ✅ Safe | Parameterized queries used |
| XSS | Not Applicable | N/A | No web interface in this code |
| Clear-text Storage | Medium | ✅ Mitigated | Required by protocol, file permissions set |
| Clear-text Logging | None | ✅ Safe | No sensitive data logged |
| Command Injection | None | ✅ Safe | subprocess.run with list args |
| Path Traversal | None | ✅ Safe | Fixed paths used |
| Authentication | Medium | ✅ Documented | PPTP protocol limitation |

---

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- ✅ Passwords stored securely (file permissions)
- ✅ No passwords in logs
- ✅ No passwords in version control

### Access Control
- ✅ Root-only file access
- ✅ Protected directories
- ✅ No world-readable files

### Monitoring
- ✅ Logging implemented
- ✅ Watchdog monitoring
- ✅ Status reporting

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (v7.4.6)
- [x] Set file permissions to 600 ✅ Implemented
- [x] Add security notes in code ✅ Implemented
- [x] Document security considerations ✅ This document

### Short-term (v7.5.0)
- [ ] Add password strength validation
- [ ] Implement failed authentication monitoring
- [ ] Add audit logging for credential changes

### Long-term (v8.0.0)
- [ ] Migrate to WireGuard or OpenVPN
- [ ] Implement credential encryption at rest
- [ ] Add multi-factor authentication support
